This project is an implementation of API Case scenarios. An api application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact.
Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks.
One popular way to expose an application and dataset is to use an API. Often, they are the public facing part of websites and micro-services so that allow outsiders to interact with them - access and modify their data. In this project, we  will access employee data via an API to organize and export them to different data structures.

### Project Requirments
- files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
-  modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')

This is a perfect example of a task that is not suited for Bash scripting, so letâ€™s build Python scripts.
