Puppet is a configuration management tool ensuring that all systems are configured to a desired and predictable state. 

You can also use Puppet as a deployment tool as it can automatically deploy software on the system. Puppet implements infrastructure as code, which means you can test the environment and ensure that it is deployed accurately.
