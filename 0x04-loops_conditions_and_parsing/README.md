This is my directory on loops conditon and parsing. The projects are structured on case scenarios when working with the shell to manipulate data. Advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash mainly looking for whatever the default version of the program is in your current environment and lends you some flexibility on diffrent systems. implementation of files and other comparison operators.
All bash scripts are executable  must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error. All my files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Virtual machine.
