This project directory is created on implentation of api advance concepts. An API, or application programming interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary layer that processes data transfers between systems.
In this project we have been given a reddit API to work with which contains  lot of endpoints available, many that dont require any form of authentication, and theres tons of information to be parsed out and presented.

### PROJECT REQUIRMENTS
- Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- code should use the PEP 8 style
-  modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
